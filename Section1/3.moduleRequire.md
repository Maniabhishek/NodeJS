- what happens behind the scene when we write rquire("./sum")
 - what require does is , it tries to resolve the module, it is nothing but the path provided in require method
 - loads the module file context is loaded according to the file module
 - wraps it inside IIFE (compile steps)
 - Evaluation module.exports
 - caching

- so whenever we use module.exports in our code, nodejs wraps the module inside IIFE
- it will look something like below
```ts
(function(module){
  // module code
})()
```
- there can be instance where one module is used inside multiple module , in such cases require will not be executed all the time but it will only be executed only once as it is going to be cached , and can be execute later on
