## LIBUV & ASYNC IO
- nodeJS is event driven architecture async IO
- JS is synchronous single threaded programming language
- synchronous means it will execute code one after other
- multithreaded it means it take some piece of code and execute in one thread and another piece of code in another thread
- but with single threaded you cannot do a lot of task at once , it executes one after other

### Synchronous 
- let's understand it with an example , let's say we are at a restaurant, and it serves pizza which take 10 min, serves burger which takes 5 mins to prepare and coke which is being served in 0 mins
-  now let's assume we have 5 customer, 1st customer orders pizza , 2nd order burger, 3rd orders coke, 4th again burger , 5th wants coke
-  now 1st order is of pizza and it takes pizza 10 mins, now next order cannot be served until the first is completed , even if someone wants coke which take 0 mins
-  once 10 mins is passed now pizza can be served , after this 2nd order will be served which takes 5 mins to complete, after 5 mins 3rd order will be take and served in 0 mins
-  so here in synchronous execution even something that take 0 mins had to wait for 15 minutes

### Asynchronous
- in asynchronous, we have same order let's say, 1st order comes and it takes 10 min to prepare so it will put it in queue, then 2nd order comes it will take 5 min so puts it again in queue, 3rd order of coke will be served immediately, 4th order comes for burger, 5th coke will be served immediately, now as 5minutes passes burger will be served to 2nd and 4th order after 10 mins pizza will also be served, so this way asynchronous execution happens faster

### Let's see how synchronous code is executed in js
```js
var a = 123
var b = 234

function multiply(a,b){
  var result = a*b
  return result
}

var c = multiply(a,b)
```

- first thing that happens when this code is being executed by v8, it creates global execution context inside call stack, when 1st line of code is executed, v8 will assign memory in heap, does the same for next line, again for function declaration it will be stored in memory heap, now when function is inovked , a functional execution context is created and function start running , result variable is created in heap, and a*b value will be stored in result , and returned to c, when function execution is completed functional execution context is also removed, and result variable which was created in memory heap , it was in functional scope , so this will be garbage collected, and c variable in memory will be stored with result of multiply

### Let's See how async code is executed in nodejs
- let's understand it with a sample code
```js
var a = 123
var b = 234

https.get("https://api.abc.com", (res)=> {
  console.log(res)
})

setTimeout(()=> {
connsole.log("setTimeout")
}, 5000)

fs.readFile("./abc.txt", "utf8", (data)=> {
  console.log("data", data)
})

function multiply(a, b){
  var result = a*b
  return result
}

var c = multiply(a,b)
console.log(c)
```
- as we know var a = 123 will be executed quickly and variable a will be created in memory heap
- similarly with var b, now code execution comes to https.get, nodejs will see it, and this is async code and it is going to take some time to execute, so how does nodejs execute async , because v8 engine is unable to handle any async code it needs some super power to do so, v8 cannot make api call, doesn't have setTimer cannot connect to DB, you also need the help of os , getting timers it is the job of os, so we need someone who can help us connect to os , these are the feature in order to connect to db and etc are provided by nodejs
- In nodejs , it is libuv library which makes it possible to achieve all these tasks
- so the moment nodejs sees async code it sends it to libuv library (library to do asynchronous task), and execution moves further
- now libuv takes the code register the callback wait for the resposne
- now code moves to setTimeout , since it is async code , this will be executed by libuv, libuv register the callback to execute it later when it is ready
- similary for fs.readFile code
- now it encounters the function it will be save in to memory heap, and finally at function execution part , functional execution context is created in call stack once it is done functional execution context goes out of the stack and finally gec is also moved out
- now which ever the code that is yet to be executed by libuv , now libuv keep checking once response from api call comes it will push the callback to call stack, and execute it one by one

- here is the code [Async code](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/NodeJS/blob/main/Section1/code/3.async/async.ts) how async code is getting executed
