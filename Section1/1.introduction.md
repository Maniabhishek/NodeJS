- nodejs is js runtime built on chrome's v8 js engine
- cross platform, open source, maintained by js foundation
- event driven architecture, async I/O
- you can't run js code without js engine, which means wherever you run js there is js engine, be it your mobile, browser, smart watch etc


### NodeJS on Server
#### What is server
- It is some computer or cpu, that is running your code, server can serve user request made to it

- before nodejs, js was only able to run on browser , and on broser it was able to run because of js engine , that js engine was v8 on chrome spider monkey on firefox
- but in order to run it outside of your browser , nodejs was developed
- after the nodejs , we were able to run it on any computer or cpu which had nodejs

#### nodejs is built on top v8 engine 
- what is v8 engine , it is nothing but a c++ program or application , which nodejs embeds , so v8 engine is one which executes the core js

#### if v8 engine can execute the js, then why do we need nodejs, we could have simply used v8 engine to execute it
- v8 follows ecamascript standard, it is basically a rule that v8 follows, so anyone who is developing js engine needs to follow these standard
- v8 can only exceute core javascript, what about apis, modules, feature like connecting to db, making http calls , these all super powers are provided by nodejs
- v8 can be embedded into any c++ programs
- nodejs is c++ programs ,which embeds v8
- computer can understand only binary code, binary code is created from assembly code, and assemby code from machine code and machine code from high level languages like c++, java, js
- node js is a runtime, which it embeds v8, but it has other powers as well
- you have heard of x86 , arm processor , the are the processor which understand machine code
