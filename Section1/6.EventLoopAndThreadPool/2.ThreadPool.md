### Thread Pool
- As we know whenever a async task are given to nodejs it delegate it to libuv, where event loop keeps monitoring call stack and callback queue where ready to be executed callbacks are queued, once call stack is empty callbacks are sent in to call stack to be executed

### Now the question arises how is libuv handling those async tasks
- now in libuv there is something known as threadpool
- let's say there are 2 async task like reading file generating crypto etc, then how is it going to execute those
- by default libuv has UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE of 4 now those two async tasks are executed using two of four threads

### can we increase the threadpool size 
- yes by changing the env variable UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE


```js
const crypto = require("crypto")


crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, derivedKey)=> {
    console.log("1. pbkdf2")
})

crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, derivedKey)=> {
    console.log("2. pbkdf2")
})

crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, derivedKey)=> {
    console.log("3. pbkdf2")
})

crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, derivedKey)=> {
    console.log("4. pbkdf2")
})

crypto.pbkdf2("password", "salt", 5000000, 50, "sha512", (err, derivedKey)=> {
    console.log("5. pbkdf2")
})

console.log('end of code')
```

### Let's see what will happen if there are more than 4 async task 
- let's understand it with code example
- above is given code which has 5 async code , since nodejs has 4 threadpool size by default
- nodejs will start reading and keeps delegating all 5 async code to libuv and main thread reaches the end of of line and call stack is free
- now libuv will see thre are 5 async operation needs to be it will first allocate thread to 1st four of them
- 5th one will keep on waiting for it chance until one of the thread is free
- once the one of the thread is free the 5th one will get the thread pool to get executed
- and hence you will see 1st four will get executed in any order the 5th one will always be executed in the end

-  as we know, In Node.js, the event-driven, non-blocking architecture handles most tasks asynchronously using the Event Loop and libuv.

### Threadpool is primarily used for:
- I/O-bound tasks (file system operations, network requests)
- CPU-intensive tasks (cryptography, compression)
- Native bindings (C++ Addons)
