## How Are promises executed

- Promises in JavaScript themselves aren’t executed by a thread pool. Instead, they are part of the asynchronous programming model that leverages the event loop and microtask queue.

### Key Points
- Event Loop & Microtasks:
 - When a promise is resolved, its .then() callbacks are scheduled as microtasks. These microtasks run on the main JavaScript thread after the current call stack is cleared.
- Underlying Asynchronous Operations:
 - While the promise mechanism and its callbacks run on the main thread, the asynchronous operations that a promise represents (such as I/O in Node.js) may be executed by a thread pool (e.g., via libuv in Node.js). However, this is separate from how promises themselves work.

### Abstraction for Asynchronous Behavior:
- Promises are an abstraction to handle asynchronous results without exposing the details of how the asynchronous work is performed. The actual work might be offloaded to system-level threads, but the resolution and callback execution always occur on the main thread.

- In summary, promises provide a structured way to work with asynchronous operations, but they don’t directly run on a thread pool. The heavy lifting might be offloaded to threads (especially in environments like Node.js), yet the promise callbacks are executed on the main event loop.
