### Are HTTP Requests Handled by the Thread Pool in Node.js?
- Outbound HTTP requests (making requests) → ❌ No, handled by the event loop & OS kernel (non-blocking I/O).
- Inbound HTTP requests (handling requests in a server) → ❌ No, handled by the event loop.
- Some underlying tasks (DNS lookup, TLS encryption, compression) → ✅ Yes, handled by the thread pool.

1. Outbound HTTP Requests (Making API Calls)
- When Node.js makes an HTTP request using http.request() or third-party libraries like axios or fetch(), it does not use the thread pool. Instead:
- The event loop delegates the network operation to the OS kernel.
- The kernel handles the request asynchronously and notifies Node.js when data is available.
- The main thread (event loop) processes the response without blocking.
```js
const https = require('https');

https.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', (res) => {
    let data = '';
    res.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
    res.on('end', () => console.log(JSON.parse(data)));
});
```
## Why No Thread Pool?
- The OS kernel handles TCP connections asynchronously.
- The event loop waits for the response, but doesn’t block execution.
- Multiple HTTP requests can be made simultaneously without extra threads.


2. Inbound HTTP Requests (Handling HTTP Requests in a Server)
- When Node.js handles incoming HTTP requests using http.createServer(), it also does not use the thread pool.
- The event loop processes requests asynchronously.
- Each request is handled by a callback, executing on the main thread.
- If a request involves CPU-heavy work (e.g., hashing, file I/O), then a worker thread may be used.

## Why No Thread Pool?
- The event loop efficiently handles thousands of concurrent requests without using extra threads.

3. When HTTP Uses the Thread Pool (DNS, TLS, Compression)
- Some underlying operations in HTTP do use the thread pool:
- ✅ DNS Lookups (dns.lookup())
- Uses the libuv thread pool unless dns.resolve() (which is async by default) is used.
- Runs in a worker thread inside the thread pool.
- ✅ TLS/SSL (HTTPS encryption/decryption)
- Uses the thread pool for CPU-intensive encryption/decryption (OpenSSL).
- ✅ Compression (zlib.gzip())
- Used for Gzip compression of HTTP responses.

```js
const dns = require('dns');

dns.lookup('example.com', (err, address) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('IP Address:', address);
});

```
Conclusion
- Regular HTTP requests (in & out) do not use the thread pool.
- Some operations like DNS lookup, HTTPS encryption, and compression use the thread pool.
- Node.js is optimized for high concurrency using non-blocking I/O rather than threads.
