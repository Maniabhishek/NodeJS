### Are HTTP Requests Handled by the Thread Pool in Node.js?
- Outbound HTTP requests (making requests) → ❌ No, handled by the event loop & OS kernel (non-blocking I/O).
- Inbound HTTP requests (handling requests in a server) → ❌ No, handled by the event loop.
- Some underlying tasks (DNS lookup, TLS encryption, compression) → ✅ Yes, handled by the thread pool.
