### LibUv And EventLoop
- As we saw in the previous notes whenever there is async code nodejs sends these code to libuv and execution thread moves ahead , once the main execution thread is available and the code that were sent to libuv let's say setTimeout, if it is ready to be executed , then this callback will be sent to call stack for execution
- but the question is how are these callback sent to call stack, there can be many callback coming from callback queue such as setTimout , setInterval, setImmediate, I/O callbacks,
- how are these callbacks being managed , so it is event loop which manages these callback , it manages the order of execution which callback will be executed when and what time
- event loops keeps checking callback queue and call stack , once the call stack or main execution thread is free , and when callbacks are ready to be executed then it will be sent to call stack by eventloop

- above is the image shown how event loops works
- event loop works in phases first it checks for timers callbacks like setTimeout or setInterval then it goes to poll (where it waits when there is no other callbacks) checks if there is any I/O callbacks callbacks from fs, https.get, crypto and such... then it goes on to check for setImmediate, and after that in the end it will check close() if socket needs to be closed
- so above is the execution phase of event loop, but there is one priority queue shown inside in the image process.nextTick and promise which will run before every phase
- for eaxmple when event loop starts, and before running the timers phase it will first check the priority queueand checks if there are any process.nextTick or promise callbacks to be executed and then move to timers phase once timers phase is executed again priority queue will be checked (the inner loop will run ) again goest to poll phase then inner loop then moves to check setImmediate then innerloop then close phase then inner loop then timer phase again , this is how it keeps running

### let's understand it with once code example

```js
const fs = require("fs")
const a = 10

setImmediate(()=>{console.log("setImmediate")})
fs.readFile("./file.txt", "utf8", (err, data)=> {console.log("file rading callback")})
setTimeout(()=> console.log('setTimeout'))
console.log(a)
console.log("end of the line")
```

- now when code start its execution reads line 1 and loads fs and allocate memory for varaible a in memory heap
- the setImmediate nodejs will send it to libuv to handle
- again fs.readFile async code nodejs will send it to libuv to handle
- setTimeout again will be sent to libuv
- now synchronous code will be executed a will be printed and then end of the line will be printed
- now call ctack is empty and main thread is unblocked
- now as we know event loop keeps checking call stack and callback queue once call stack is empty it will start sending callbacks to call stack for execution
- now setTimeout and setImmediate will be ready immediately , thus setTimout in its first phase will be checked and executed (even before timer phase, priority queue would have checked since it was empty and will process further) and now again goes to check priority queue after this goes to poll phase where no callbacks are there as reading file will take time after this again goes to inner loop i.e., priority queue, then move to setImmediate check there is callback waiting then it will be executed
- and then in the end goes to close phase and then again checks inner loop then timner phase (which is empty thus moves murther) again inner loop then let's file has been read and it is ready to be executed the event loop will send this file callback to call stack to execute it
- and once in the end when it goes idle and there are no callbacks to be executed then it waits at poll phase as most of the callbacks are executed at I/O callbacks why does it wait it waits because of timer let's say setTimeout with 5sec now it has to wait for 5sec then what it does , it will move to next phase poll phase and waits here for some I/O callbacks to come so that it can execute it meanwhile once 5 secs over it goes again to timer phase and executes


### another example [code](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/NodeJS/blob/main/Section1/code/3.async/eventLoopExplained2.js)
```js
const fs = require("fs")

setImmediate(()=> console.log('setImmediate')) // 5

setTimeout(()=> {console.log('time expired')}) // 4

Promise.resolve("Promise").then((d)=> console.log(d)) // 3

fs.readFile("./file1.txt", "utf8", (err, data)=> {
    setTimeout(()=> {
        console.log("2nd timer") // 8
    }, 0)

    process.nextTick(()=> console.log('2nd nextTick')) // 7

    setImmediate(()=> console.log("2nd immediate"))

    console.log('file reading cb') // 6
})

process.nextTick(()=> console.log('nextTick'))  //2

console.log("last line of the file") //1
```
- setImmediate will be register in callback queue
- setTimeout will be regitered too immediately as there is no waiting time
- similary promise which is being resolved immediately so it will go to promise queue which is priority queue
- same for fs
- and then sees nexttick
- and prints the last line
- now call stack is free
- event loop now it will check call stack and callback queue , in very first phase of priority queue, next tick will be executed first and then promise
- now goes to timer phase and execute setInterval then setImmediate now goes to inner loop there is no callback there
- then goes poll phase (let's say file is being read) and now its callback will be executed
- it is in poll phase and start executing async code will pushed to libuv, last line will be printed **file reading cb**
- then we have setTimeout, process.nextTick and setImmediate
- after poll phase it goes to inner phase i.e., priority phase and executes nexttick
- after this it moves to setImmediate phase and executes its callback
- after that goes to close and then timers phase (in between ofcourse it will go to inner loop before every phase close and timers phase )
- then it finds setTimeoutCallback and it will finally be executed


### One full cycle of event loop is called Tick

> - if we check event loop cycle in official documentation they have mentioned about another phase i.e., pending callbacks , idle and prepeare phase
- in the above phase mostly those callbacks which didn't get executed in previous poll phase then it will be executed in this phase
- and this phase comes right after timers phase
- there can be some situation when some callbacks in poll phase couldn't get executed because defering some callbacks
- idle and prepare are for internal , which developer need not to take care of
