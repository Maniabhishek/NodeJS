### Optimizing Node.js for High Concurrency ðŸš€
- Node.js is designed for high concurrency with non-blocking I/O and an event-driven architecture, but it can still struggle with CPU-intensive tasks or high request loads. Hereâ€™s how to optimize Node.js performance effectively.


1. Use Worker Threads for CPU-Intensive Tasks
- The Node.js event loop is single-threaded, so CPU-heavy operations (e.g., hashing, image processing) block the main thread.
- âœ… Solution: Use worker_threads to offload CPU-bound work to separate threads.
- Example: Offloading CPU Work with Worker Threads
```js
const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');

function runWorkerTask(workerData) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const worker = new Worker('./worker-task.js', { workerData });
        worker.on('message', resolve);
        worker.on('error', reject);
        worker.on('exit', (code) => {
            if (code !== 0) reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
        });
    });
}

// Call worker thread
runWorkerTask(100000000).then(console.log).catch(console.error);
```
```js
const { parentPort, workerData } = require('worker_threads');

let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < workerData; i++) {
    sum += i;
}
parentPort.postMessage(sum);

```
