- **globalThis**: The globalThis property provides a standard way of accessing the global this value (and hence the global object itself) across environments. Unlike similar properties such as window and self, it's guaranteed to work in window and non-window contexts. In this way, you can access the global object in a consistent manner without having to know which environment the code is being run in. To help you remember the name, just remember that in global scope the this value is globalThis.

### module
-  module protect variable and function from leaking
- when we tried executing function calculateSum function from sum file [code](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/NodeJS/tree/main/Section1/code/1.moduleAndExports) by just using require method we saw it was not executed but the first line of console log was executed
-  this is because module protect variable and function from leaking , in order to access those variables we need to export those function or variable to use it in other files
