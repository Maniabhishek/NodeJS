- **globalThis**: The globalThis property provides a standard way of accessing the global this value (and hence the global object itself) across environments. Unlike similar properties such as window and self, it's guaranteed to work in window and non-window contexts. In this way, you can access the global object in a consistent manner without having to know which environment the code is being run in. To help you remember the name, just remember that in global scope the this value is globalThis.
  - globalThis is a standard global object in JavaScript that provides a unified way to access the global scope, no matter the environment (browser, Node.js, etc.)
### module
-  module protect variable and function from leaking
- when we tried executing function calculateSum function from sum file [code](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/NodeJS/tree/main/Section1/code/1.moduleAndExports) by just using require method we saw it was not executed but the first line of console log was executed
-  this is because module protect variable and function from leaking , in order to access those variables we need to export those function or variable to use it in other files
- checkout code [module export code](https://github.com/Maniabhishek/NodeJS/tree/main/Section1/code/2.moduleAndExports) how can we export functions and variables
- this type of export is known as commonjs export

### ES6 export 
-  we can also export methods or variable using this new way
-  first create package.json file and add property type as module
-  once added we can start using import {abc} from "./abc.js"

### Difference in using commonjs and ES6 export and import
- in commonJs require is used as by default, and in ES6 we need to use import and export
- commonJs is older way and ES6 is newer way of importing and exporting
- commonJs is synchronous and ES6 is asynchronous
- commonJs is non-strict mode whereas ES6 is strict mode
  - In non-strict zone if you try to create variable without using var or let keyword , nodejs wont give you error on running , but if you are using ES6 then it will throw error 
  - x = "abc" // this wont throw error in non-strict mode but in strict mode it will start throwing error
