### how is js code executed in js v8 engine


- as shown above in the image
- the code when write and try to execute , it goes through the v8 engine
- inside v8 engine code is first parsed and converted in to smaller piece of code (Lexical analysis i.e., tokenization)
- and code will be converted into AST (abstract syntax tree)
- and after that the code is passed through interpreter
- there are two way things one is interpreter (read line by line and starts execution) and comiler(which converts the whole code in machine code ) initial heavy but execution is fast
- js uses best of both it is JIT (just in time compiler)
- when the code is sent to iginition interpreter code is then converted to byte code execution will happend then
- there will be momment some pice of code is being repeated or used a lot then v8 will send the code (hot code) to turbofan compiler
- and it generates the optimized code and excuted later
- this process when sends the code to turbofan complier is known as optimization process, also in some situation there will be need to deoptimize the code
- let's we have a function abc(a,b) in our code and it is being executed again and again, where a and b in parameter are number
- so js will optimize the code and will always take these variables as number, first time it is called checks and optimizes the code
- next time the execution will be faster , but in next function call we change the type instead passing number we pass string in the same function then this time js will not understand and deoptimizes the code and send the code to ignition interpreter, and finally executes it
