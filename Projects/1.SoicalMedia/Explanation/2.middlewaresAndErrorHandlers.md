```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/test", (req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('in 1st handler')
    next()
    // res.send("1st response from testing")
}, (req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 2nd handler")
    res.send("2nd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```

- as we can see above we can have multiple route handler we can add as many as we want , example code below 
```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/test", (req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('in 1st handler')
    next()
    // res.send("1st response from testing")
}, (req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 2nd handler")
    res.send("2nd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
},(req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 3rd handler")
    res.send("3rd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})
```

- in the above code when you call /test endpoint , then it goes to 1st route handler logs "in 1st handler" -> next() , next will send the control to the next route handler , where it will log in 2nd handler and sends the response as 2nd response from testing but it wont go to the next handler as we dont have next
- now these route in the middle is called as middleware , since these method calls comes between the request and response , any common code like authentication can be part of middleware
```js
 app.use("/", rH, [rH2, rH3], rH4)
```

- we can add route handler in one single array or comma seperated however we want
