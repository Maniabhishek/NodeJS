```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/test", (req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('in 1st handler')
    next()
    // res.send("1st response from testing")
}, (req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 2nd handler")
    res.send("2nd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```

- as we can see above we can have multiple route handler we can add as many as we want , example code below 
```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/test", (req, res, next)=>{
    console.log('in 1st handler')
    next()
    // res.send("1st response from testing")
}, (req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 2nd handler")
    res.send("2nd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
},(req, res)=> {
    console.log("in 3rd handler")
    res.send("3rd response from testing ")
    console.log('line 12')
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})
```

- in the above code when you call /test endpoint , then it goes to 1st route handler logs "in 1st handler" -> next() , next will send the control to the next route handler , where it will log in 2nd handler and sends the response as 2nd response from testing but it wont go to the next handler as we dont have next
- now these route in the middle is called as middleware , since these method calls comes between the request and response , any common code like authentication can be part of middleware
```js
 app.use("/", rH, [rH2, rH3], rH4)
```

- we can add route handler in one single array or comma seperated however we want

#### Want to send some data to admin
```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {
    res.send("all data")
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```
- this above route , let's say send all the data from database , but the problem here is anyone can access this route
- so we need to restrict this api endpoint inorder to restrict the api to authorized user
- below is the code where we have added dummy logic to restrict api
```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {
    let token = "xyza"
    if(token !== "xyz") res.status(401).send("unauthorized")
    res.send("all data")
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})
```

- now the above code will only allow the authorized user to access this api
- now again if i want to add another api for admin then, will we keep adding this logic , no we can use a middleware
- let's say we want to add a middleware for admin then we can use ```js app.use(/admin, ()=> {})``` all the routes matching "/admin" will go through this middleware
- let's say we have get api and we want all the get api to use a particular middleware then we can use ```jsapp.get("/")``` similarly for post ```js app.post("/")```
- for above scenario if for admin let's use ```app.use()``` to invoke authentication middleware to admin api, ```js app.use("/admin")``` app.all() is similar to app.use

```js
const express = require("express")

const app = express()

app.use("/admin", (req, res, next) => {
    const token = "XYZ"
    const isAuthorizedAdmin = token === "XYZ"
    if(!isAuthorizedAdmin){
        res.status(401).send("unauthorized")
    }
    next()
})

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {

    res.status(200).send("all data")
})

app.get("/admin/getUserData", (req, res)=> {
    res.status(200).send("all user data")
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```

- now the above code shows, all the api endpoint that starts with /admin will now go through the middleware
- to organize the code better we will create a seperate middlewares folder and can write seperate admin middleware
```js
const express = require("express")
const {AdminAuth, UserAuth} = require("./middlewares/auth")

const app = express()

app.use("/admin", AdminAuth)

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {

    res.status(200).send("all data")
})

app.get("/admin/getUserData", (req, res)=> {
    res.status(200).send("all user data")
})

app.use("/user", UserAuth)

app.get("/user/profile", (req, res)=> {
    res.send("user profile")
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```

- in the above code we have added two different middleware , one for admin and another for user , where user has it's own middleware to autheticate
- any endpoint matching /user will go through the UserAuth


### Error Handling
```js
const express = require("express")
const {AdminAuth, UserAuth} = require("./middlewares/auth")

const app = express()

app.use("/admin", AdminAuth)

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {
    console.log('/admin/getAllData')
    throw Error("some error")
    console.log('first')
    res.status(200).send("all data")
})


app.use("/", (err, req, res, next) => {
    if(err){
        res.status(500).send("something went wrong")
    }
})



app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})
```

- now in above code , we are deliberately throwing error to generate some error , now code goes to "/admin/getAllData" endpoint and it threw  some error , now this error will be handled gracefully by next handler ```app.use("/")``` and in this handler err should be as the paramenter in the router handler , this is one of the way of handling error
- but we can actually handle error much better way by using try and catch
-  below code shows , the order of routes are important , if we move the error handler route to above it will throw error to repsonse and not handled gracefully 
```js
const express = require("express")
const {AdminAuth, UserAuth} = require("./middlewares/auth")

const app = express()

app.use("/admin", AdminAuth)

app.use("/", (err, req, res, next) => {
    if(err){
        res.status(500).send("something went wrong")
    }
})

app.get("/admin/getAllData", (req, res)=> {
    console.log('/admin/getAllData')
    throw Error("some error")
    console.log('first')
    res.status(200).send("all data")
})

app.listen("3000", (err)=> {
    console.log('running on port 3000')
})

```
- to solve the above issue we need to move the app.use("/") router below the endpoint ("admin/getAllData")
