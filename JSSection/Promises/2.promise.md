> A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (resolved) or failure (rejected) of an asynchronous operation.

```js
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Success!");
  }, 1000);
});

myPromise.then(console.log).catch(console.error);

```

### States of a Promise:
- Pending → Initial state, operation not completed.
- Fulfilled (Resolved) → Operation successful.
- Rejected → Operation failed.
