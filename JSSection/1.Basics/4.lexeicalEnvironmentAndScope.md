- scope where you can access a variable that is called as scope


```js
function a(){
  console.log(b)
}

var b = 10
a()
```

- after the execution of the above code when a function is invoked , inside the function it tries to print b but there is no variable b inside function scope then it will look for this variable to the outer scope
- and it finds variable b in global scope, if we remove the var b then it will print not defined

```js
function a(){
  var b = 10
  c()
  function c(){
    console.log(b)
  }
}

a()

console.log(b)
```
 -  the above code execution when tries to access v outside the function a then fec in which b would have created must have been removed when it reached to this line (printing b) then there is no variable b in memory
 -  hence it will throw error as uncaught reference error: not defined
