1. How Node.js handles HTTP requests without threads (Event Loop & OS Kernel)?
2. When & why Node.js uses the Thread Pool in HTTP (DNS, TLS, Compression)?
3. Performance comparison: Thread Pool vs Event Loop in Node.js?
4. How to optimize Node.js for high concurrency (e.g., worker threads, load balancing)?
5. Any specific real-world example, like building a high-performance API server?
